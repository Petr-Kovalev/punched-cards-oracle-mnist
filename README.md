### 'Punched cards' for Oracle-MNIST

*Object recognition by sparse random binary data lookup. Based on [this article](https://petr-kovalev.medium.com/punched-cards-object-recognition-97523a98857b)*

Performing single-shot Oracle-MNIST ancient characters recognition by lookup over the most different sparse input bit sets of the training data (out of 28⋅28⋅8 = 6272 bits per training sample)

Bit vector set similarity evaluation using the maximum spanning tree is described in [this article](https://petr-kovalev.medium.com/bit-vector-set-similarity-maximum-spanning-tree-2121b05c7b29)
